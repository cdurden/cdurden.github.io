<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>First order finite difference models; derivatives — limits, power rule,
product rule, quotient rule, chain rule; tangent line approximation;
graphing, optimization; exponential and logarithmic functions —
growth and decay models; integrals — computation, area, total change;
applications in life, management, and social sciences.</p>
<h2 id="course-objectives-and-approach">Course Objectives and Approach</h2>
<p>Students will understand the key ideas of calculus and how the ideas apply to models that are used in the life and management sciences. Lectures will emphasize key concepts and present examples of their use. Problem sessions will present opportunities for students to practice applying the concepts. This work will consist of exercises similar to those presented in class and inquiry-based learning activities intended to deepen conceptual understanding. Inquiry-based learning requires students to apply ideas from class to answer a question that requires a different method of solution than what they have already seen. Since part of solving a problem is recognizing when the solution is adequate, students will be expected to make efforts to convince themselves that a solution makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Calculus and Its Applications</em> by Goldstein, Lay, Schneider, and Asmar.
13th edition. ISBN: 978-0321-84890-1.</li>
<li><a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~cldurden/ma131/files/MA131Supplement.pdf">MA 131 Supplement</a> (available online for free).</li>
<li>Webassign access (available for $32.95 at http://webassign.ncsu.edu)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: C- or better in MA 107 or MA 111, or 520 or better on the
SAT Subject Test in Mathematics, Level 2 on the NCSU Math Skills Test,
or 2 or better on an AP Calculus exam.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong>: Credit is not allowed for both MA 131 and MA 121 or
MA 141.</p>
<h2 id="class-expectations">Class Expectations</h2>
<p>This is a college level math course. I expect students to actively participate in learning — this means attending and paying attention in all
lectures and problem sessions, reviewing course materials outside of the classroom, and asking for help when needed.
 This class will operate best on a basis of cooperation, sincere effort, and mutual respect.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>In accordance with university policy, attendance will be taken. Besides the
obvious not showing up at all, missing at least one half of lecture, having
your laptop out, texting, reading the newspaper, or sleeping during class
will also count as an absence.
All anticipated absences must be excused in advance of a test day. These
include University trips, required court attendance, or religious
observances. Emergency absences must be reported within one week of
returning to class. Students with ~~four~~ five or fewer absences over the course of
the semester will have their lowest test grade dropped.
<em>Please note that absences from both lectures and problems sessions count toward this number.</em></p>

<h3 id="homework-webassign">Homework (WebAssign)</h3>
<p>Homework for this course will consist of online problem sets using WebAssign. You are expected to check WebAssign regularly for the due dates, which may change depending on class progress. Extensions may be granted under reasonable circumstances via e-mail request to the course instructor, although late assignments may incur a penalty. All WebAssign assignments that are listed as "Homework" will count toward the Homework grade.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>Four tests are scheduled during class time.
The dates of the tests are listed on the course schedule.
If you anticipate a scheduling conflict that prevents you from taking a test or the final exam on the scheduled date, you are responsible for contacting the instructor during the first two weeks of class to make arrangements.
The lowest of these test grades will be dropped if the total number of absences (excused or
unexcused) does not exceed four. </p>
<h4 id="test-corrections">Test corrections</h4>
<p>After receiving your corrected test, correction disputes must
be presented to me within one class week of being handed back.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>You will need paper and a writing utensil. Please use a pencil, blue ink, or black ink to write solutions to tests.
You will need access to WebAssign in order to complete the homework.
You do not need a calculator for this course. In fact <strong>calculators are not permitted on tests and exams</strong>.
However, if during class or while working on homework, you would like to check your arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so forth) with a scientific calculator, please feel free.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity-standards">Academic Integrity Standards</h2>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic
integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct found at
http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01.</p>
<h3 id="honor-pledge">Honor Pledge</h3>
